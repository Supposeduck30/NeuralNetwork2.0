# Neural Network 2.0
This neural network does the same thing as the other neural network I made, but this one is more accurate.

## How to run 
- Make sure you have python installed
- Save the script as NeuralNetwork.py
- Run the script in your terminal with "python NeuralNetwork.py"
- You can also copy and paste the code into an IDE or an online python compiler and run it there

## How it works
- It is better than the other neural network because that neural network had 5 neurons, while this one has 11 neurons in total
- This neural network has 2 hidden layers of 4 neurons each as opposed to 1 hidden layer with 2 neurons
